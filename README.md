My \#TidyTuesday contributions
================

Welcome to my \#TidyTuesday repo. Clicking on a plot will take you to
the code I wrote to build it.

## What is \#TidyTuesday?

From the organisers:

> Join the R4DS Online Learning Community in the weekly \#TidyTuesday
> event! Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to
> that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. While the dataset will
> be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to
> apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a
> true tidy format. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills,
> get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater
> \#RStats community! As such we encourage everyone of all skills to
> participate!
